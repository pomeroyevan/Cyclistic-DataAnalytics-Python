Most people completing the Google Data Analytics Certificate forgot to remove recording errors or large outlies like negative or great distances and ride durations.  Aditionally most other analysts did not include distance and speed data and only relied on duration information. Although it was not necessary here is is still an important factor to consider.\n\nSome things that I wanted to inclucde but was incapable: geographic analysis based on station and latitude & longitude data.
